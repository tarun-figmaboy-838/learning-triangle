 * One perspective for the whole yard-to-bridge move (pseudo-3D over 2D art).

 * World axes: x across the stage, `height` above the ground (stage px, measured at the front plane),
 * z into the scene: z = 0 is the yard platform's plane (the frames stand at its baseY), z = 1 is the
 * bridge deck's plane (frames stand on the road at deckY).
 *
 * The camera looks at a painted horizon; a point recedes toward the vanishing point by
 *   scale(z) = 1 / (1 + k z),   ground(z) = horizonY + (nearGroundY - horizonY) * scale(z)
 * and k is solved so the ground at z = 1 is exactly the bridge deck. With the horizon where the
 * backdrop paints it, a frame on the bridge is drawn at 0.6 of its size on the platform.
